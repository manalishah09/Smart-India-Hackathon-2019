<h1>Talking Fingers</h1>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
The purpose of our project ‘Talking Fingers’ is to help normal human being to communicate with the deaf and dumb. Normal people are not aware about the Indian Sign Language, that is used by deaf and dumb people to communicate with each other as well as communicate with normal people. So for that reason, we need help of a person also known as an interpreter to convey our message to the blind people. So, to eradicate the need of the interpreter we are designing an application that will help to convey our message to the deaf and dumb people. Also, it will help them to convey their emotions as well.
